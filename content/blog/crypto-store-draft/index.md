### Side project? Or a one-way ticket to prison? 

I recently stumbled upon a project that was intriguing because it was so simple. It's called [onetem.store](https://oneitem.store).

What is it? Well, it's an online store builder. There are hundreds of those, but this one is interesting because of what it _doesn't_ do. There's no inventory, no shipping tracker, no pop-ups. [The creator](https://tinyprojects.dev/) built it in about a week and then sold it for a couple thousand bucks. Not bad!


This got me thinking. Can we do better? What if we could skip the whole payments part where you pay 3% tax to Stripe? Disclaimer: Stripe is great. I use them professionally and I love the people and the product - they make it easy for us to accept payments and send money all around the world. They're well worth their fees.

A bit of background. My day job is at [Cameo.com](https://www.cameo.com/praz?ref=blog), where I'm the tech lead of the Payments team. We do regular Web2 marketplace-style payments, but recently we've also taken the plunge into [Web3](https://pass.cameo.com). We'll have more to announce in this area soon. As for me, I've been interested in crypto ever since the run in 2017. I work in the Payments space, so it's a professional obligation to stay up to date on the latest tech.


The coolest thing I've seen recently in crypto is [Solana Pay](https://solana.com/news/solana-pay-announcement). Take this with a grain of salt, I'm a payments nerd. Solana Pay is basically a pre-built smart contract and some Javascript libraries that let merchants easily accept payments in Solana.


Why is it cool? For me, it hit home when I fired up my terminal and sent a couple bucks to a friend _instantly_ with Solana. And it was free! It reminded me of the first time I used Venmo, except this was even better - there's no middleman, no account verification, nothing.

We now have a way to combine these two ideas.

### **online store**  ü§ù  **instant, free payments**

And so the Simple Crypto Store (plz help me find a better name) was born! Create an online store in 30 seconds and start selling your stuff right away. No payment processor needed. Zero payment processing fees.

### Why would I use this?

Do you sell stuff online? Are you tired of paying up to [9% fees on Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/pricing)?

### Problems (besides Jail)

This project might end with me in prison, but we'll get to that in a bit.

There are three problems when transaction online with crypto. First, there's no chargebacks. Second, the payment processing fees are shifted to the buyer. Lastly, your buyer needs to have a crypto wallet, which means you're drastically shrinking your total addressable market.

Contrast this with the current way we do things - credit cards. There are a bunch of benefits to buying stuff with a credit card. Got charged for something you don't want to pay for? Call Chase and they'll take it off your statement. Lose your card at the bar? They'll send ya a new one, free of charge. You have all the power. Why are credit card issuers so happy to help you out?

Because you're the product, of course. American Express has their hand in both jars. You get to fork over $600 a year for the privilege of dropping that Platinum card on the table in front of all your friends. But they're also taking a cut of that transaction on the back end! (Remember when some businesses didn't accept Amex?) Different cards cost more for merchants to accept.

Cryptocurrencies like Solana give us a way to cut out the middleman, but this comes with a few downsides.

Let's say you buy something with Solana and it never shows up. Who do you call? Sorry Karen, there's no manager you can speak to. This is a real problem for buyers! How can we get around it?

One way to solve this problem is with an escrow payment. The second (weaker) option is social proof, like reviews. Escrow payments don't always make sense because it's too operationally expensive for low-value transactions.

Could reviews work? The nice part about a public database (aka a blockchain) is that anyone can read it. We can verify that a review is legit, because we can see that this person actually bought the thing that they're reviewing.

Has this worked in the past? Reviews worked great for Airbnb, but not as well for Amazon. It's well known that most Amazon reviews [are bullshit](https://www.amzfinder.com/blog/top-100-facebook-groups-list-amazon-reviews/).

This seemed to work pretty well on the Silk Road, which brings us back to the Jail part. Anyone can sign up and sell anything, and the buyers pay in crypto? The Simple Crypto Store looks a lot like the Silk road. We've heard this story before, except this time the guy who made the thing is telling you about it on his blog. Please don't sell illegal stuff. I really don't want to have to learn how to do machine learning to filter through all newly created products.

### Roadmap

I think this project could go a lot of ways. Adding reviews would be cool, and maybe necessary. When I figure out how to do it, I'll need to add the ability to pay with ETH and Bitcoin Lighning ([let me know](https://twitter.com/prazgaitis) if you have tips on how to do it!).

There are a few ways I'd like to try and monetize this project. I'd like to keep payment processing free for merchants. Maybe a 1-2% fee would be good, just to prevent money laundering? Shopify charges a monthly fee, so that's another option. Another option is offering escrow for larger transactions. There are also upsell opportunities -- multiple products, multiple photos per product, custom domains, memberships, digital downloads, etc. The opportunities are endless!

Let me know what you think, and if you have something to sell, let's do it! üöÄ
