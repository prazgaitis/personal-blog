You know the feeling. A notification pops up for a meeting that starts in 1 minute. The meeting room has some bizarre name -- you're positive you've seen it before -- yet you have no idea where it is. Time to panic!

We've all been there. This happened to me so many times when I worked at Braintree that I decided to do something about it. Here's the ideal workflow:

- slack notification for a meeting comes in
- you have no idea where the room is
- you type right in Slack: `/wheres Millennium Park` or whatever your conference room is named
- it shows you a map
- you get to your meeting on time!

I did the majority of the work for this project a few months ago, but I didn't have time to do a proper writeup, or even a launch for that matter.
